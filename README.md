# DEFGA: Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for Gender Employment Trends in Austria

## Project Overview

The primary purpose of the DEFGA project is to design and implement a comprehensive Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) framework. This framework aims to seamlessly integrate and visualize gender employment data from various sources within Austria, thereby enabling robust spatial analysis to derive valuable insights for policy formulation and understanding socio-economic disparities.

### Key Objectives:

* **Data Integration:** Collect and standardize gender employment data from authoritative sources such as Statistik Austria and Eurostat, storing it in a PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database for efficient spatial querying.
* **Open Geoservices Development:** Publish OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)-compliant web services, including Web Map Services (WMS) for real-time data access, through platforms like GeoServer and ArcGIS Server. Metadata management is facilitated via GeoNetwork.
* **Spatial Analysis Enablement:** Facilitate advanced spatial analysis capabilities to identify significant employment trends and disparities across both urban and rural regions of Austria.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize gender employment patterns and trends.


## Outcomes

The tangible outcome of the DEFGA SDI project is an interactive dashboard that allows for the visualization and analysis of gender employment trends across Austria over a 10-year period. This tool empowers users to:

* Explore gender-specific disparities in employment across different regions.
* Analyze dynamic visualizations that highlight temporal trends.
* Examine contrasts in employment patterns between urban and rural areas.

This SDI framework and its interactive dashboard serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public to gain deeper insights into gender employment dynamics in Austria.

## Technologies Used
